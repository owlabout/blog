# I'm rare

[In a recent article](https://css-tricks.com/front-of-the-front-back-of-the-front/) of Chris Coyer's, he introduced me to Brad Frost's concept of [*Front of the Front / Back of the Front*](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/).
It divides frontend engineers into different categories – with blurry lines, of course. This is in addition to the "classical" *backend developer*.

I like the distinction because it puts a name to the ever-growing complexity of web development. It helps to understand why things that might have been done by one person in the past, usually cannot anymore.
Just go look at the list of responsibilities in Brad's post. Knowing and doing all of that is hard.

As Chris puts it:

> Full-stack makes me feel like you’re deeply knowledgeable about literally everything across not only the front-end spectrum, but back-end too. Brad says that’s uncommon and I’ll up that and say it’s downright rare.

Yet, it is what I would call myself. *Full-stack*. This sounds arrogant. It's saying "Look at me, I'm special".
I like this term *rare*. I don't see myself as special. I am however a deep generalist. I seldomly meet (or see people online) that have the same understanding across the stack as I do.
Of course there are lots of specialists that know more.

Sometimes I feel like people are shaming this sort of generalist. (Not in this case). And mostly with good intention. Unexperienced people in our field make the mistake to call themselves full-stack, just because they have heard about topics across the stack or done some tutorials. This is dangerous, because it errodes the confidence in their ability to self-assess.
Following the webpack setup guide doesn't make you a back of the backend developer, as little as knowing CSS properties makes you a front of the frontend developer.

Maybe I am falling in that trap as well.
On the other hand I feel like there are people, such es myself, that really do know their stuff across the stack.
Again, this is not to say we are special, just that we do exist.

I take a lot of time digging through source code of all kinds of frameworks, libraries and build tools – be it backend or frontend. Occasionally I try building my own. Just for fun. I also like setting up docker containers from scratch and building designs. This is interesting to me. Doing this for more than 10 years, has allowed me to build knowledge across the stack in ways most people haven't.

This is *rare*. This is my niche.

It's not for everyone, nor should it be.
This takes *a lot* of time and commitment. Just as being a specialist, an expert in any field does.

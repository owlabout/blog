# I'm rare

[In a recent article](https://css-tricks.com/front-of-the-front-back-of-the-front/) of Chris Coyer's, he introduced me to Brad Frost's concept of [*Front of the Front / Back of the Front*](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/).
He suggests that it is no longer enough, to divide web developers into frontend and backend and therefore creates two types of frontend engineers - the front-of-the-front developer and the back-of-the-front developer.
<!-- It divides frontend engineers into different categories – with blurry lines, of course. This is in addition to the "classical" *backend developer*. -->

I like the distinction because it puts a name to the ever-growing complexity of web development. It helps to understand why things that might have been done by one person in the past, usually cannot anymore.
Just go look at the list of responsibilities in Brad's post. Knowing and doing all of that is hard.

If the complexity and depth of frontend development have grown so much, that we need new terms to explain an engineer's area of expertise, the term *full-stack developer* seems all the more audacious. Does this type of engineer even exist anymore?
<!-- Mir hatte hier die Überleitung zu full-stack ein bisschen gefehlt  -->

As Chris puts it:

> Full-stack makes me feel like you’re deeply knowledgeable about literally everything across not only the front-end spectrum but back-end too. Brad says that’s uncommon and I’ll up that and say it’s downright rare.

I agree with Chris. Yet, it is what I would call myself. *Full-stack*. I guess that would make me rare.
I like the term *rare*. I don't see myself as special. Being a full-stack developer does not in any way make me *better* than e.g. a back-of-the-front developer. What I am, is a deep generalist. I seldomly come across developers that have the same understanding across the stack as I do.
Of course in any given area of the stack, you will find many specialists that know more than me.

I often feel that people will respond with a certain level of skepticism if you tell them that you have solid knowledge and experience across the full stack. This skepticism comes with good intention. Unexperienced people in our field will often make the mistake to call themselves full-stack, just because they have heard about topics across the stack or done some tutorials. As Chris rightly states, these people may be confusing full-stack with cross-stack. This is dangerous because it erodes the confidence in their ability to self-assess.
Following the webpack setup guide doesn't make you a back-of-the-frontend developer. Knowing CSS properties doesn't make you a front-of-the-frontend developer.

Maybe I am falling into that trap as well.
However, I feel like there are people, such as myself, that really do know their stuff across the stack.
Again, this is not to say we are special, or better, just that we do exist.

I spend a lot of time digging through source code of all kinds of frameworks, libraries, and build tools – be it backend or frontend. Occasionally I try building my own. Just for fun. I also like setting up docker containers from scratch and building designs. All of this is interesting to me. Doing this for more than 10 years has allowed me to build knowledge across the stack in ways, I believe, most people haven't.

This is *rare*. This is my niche.

It's not for everyone, nor should it be.
This takes *a lot* of time and commitment. Just as being a specialist, an expert in any field does.
